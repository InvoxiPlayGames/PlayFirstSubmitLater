# PlayFirst(SubmitLater)
**Allows for automated elective score submission, including preventing submission of failed NF scores. For BS 1.16.4+**

Ever received trolly requests that you regret entertaining and now you have crap all over your ScoreSaber? Or is 14star OV forever dragging down your rank acc because your friends ran the map in MP (back in the day) while you went to eat? Now you can stop it from happening again! 
This mod means you can play all the shitmaps and practice high stars with reckless abandon. No longer will you scream when finally pass OV but it was in practice mode or when you didn't manage to pause fast enough to quit a bad map.

## How To Use
- **Pause Menu:** Adds button to show if your current run will be submitted. Click twice (safety feature) to disable for your current run. Your decision for the run is final so choose wisely :) To enable UI, toggle on `Submit Later` and start a map (you can untoggle after to keep the UI without automatic pausing).
- **Submit Later:** Automatically pauses at the end of each song so you can make your decision. _You can disable score and keep your BeatSavior/Slice Visualizer data if you click continue and finish the map._ Automatic pausing is only for Solo Mode.
- **Better NoFail:** Stops submission when you fail on NF. Not enabled in Campaigns as some missions require NF.
- **Minimum Song Duration:** Automatically turns off submission for maps shorter than the time set in seconds.
- **Disable All Score Submission:** No scores will be set locally or online for any mode.

**The toggles "stack".** You can enable any combination so use your judgement.

**Note:** If your map has blocks in the last fractions of a second, `Submit Later` still pauses if toggled on. This is by design and will never be an issue for Rank, for shitmaps use your judgement :)
- Place PlayFirst.dll in Plugins folder
- Requires BSIPA, BSML, BS_Utils
